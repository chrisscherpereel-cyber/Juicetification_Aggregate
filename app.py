Juicetification: Aggregate Anxiety
An individual experiential Streamlit simulation of aggregate production planning.

Students BUILD chase and level aggregate plans by hand: they pick the data they
need, choose worksheet columns (with reasons), select formulas, then TYPE every
value of the 12-month worksheet themselves. The app checks their work and coaches
them toward the fix WITHOUT revealing the numbers (a last-resort reveal exists).
